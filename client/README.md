# Champion's Festival - A PTCG Results Database by Jeremy Lim

### Description

Just a small project done by a UNSW Commerce/Computer Science student out of boredom.
It aims to collect data of Pokemon TCG results in the Australian and New Zealand
competitive circuit, in order to be used for analytical uses by other people.
There are plenty of extensible improvements, such as automated tournament collection,
decklist integration, player data, etc.
The front-end is built using JavaScript and React.js and the back-end is built
using Express.js, Node.js and PostgreSQL.
